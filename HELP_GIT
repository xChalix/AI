* Very good tutorial:
  -> https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository

* clone Project:
  -> git clone git@github.com:xChalix/AI.git

* configure your name and email
  -> git config user.name "Your Name"
  -> git config user.email your@email.ac.uk

* manage the stash
  -> git status //shows all files which are selected for commit
  -> git add file_or_directory //adds a file or directory to the stash
  -> git add -A //adds EVERYTHING for the commit
  -> git reset //resets the added files, so you can add them again

* make a commit
  -> git commit    //commits the stasth
  -> git commit -a //commits every CHANGED file
  -> add the option -m "comment" for a quick commit.

* view history:
  -> git log --oneline -n [number] --decorate //en/dis able the optional commands for better results

* view older commit:
  -> git checkout 12345[first 5 letters of commit id] //type HEAD for going back


* create branches
  -> git branch [name] //does not checkout the branch
  -> git checkout -b [name] //creates a new branch and checks it out
  -> git branch -r // shows all local (without -r) and remote (with -r) branches

* merge
  -> git merge [branch] //merges branch into the current branch

* SYNCING
  -> git fetch //downloads the latest changes
  -> git merge origin/master //make sure, you are in your local master branch when doing this.

  -> git pull --rebase //same as above, --rebase gets rid of unnecessary merges.
  -> git push <branch> //upload your changes, branch is optional
